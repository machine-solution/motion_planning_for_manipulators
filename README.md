Congradulations! You have completed installation.  

# Run
For run on linux you can use 'run_linux' file. Execute this in the root of the repository.  
```
./run_linux
```

Or you can compile this using Makefile
```

```

After this operation in the root of this repository you can find 'manipulator' file. Run it.

```

If you get into trouble with running some of this files, do this and try again:
```
chmod +x <execution_file>
```

# Run tests
